In summary from the completed Pandas code, we can see see that when comparing the top and bottom performing schools, of the 5 best performing schools, 3 of them are independent, which comes to 60%, and of the 5 lowest performing schools, 4 of them were government schools which comes to 80%. This could imply that overall, students at independent schools perform better in maths and reading than in government schools. The scores by school type also support this claim as independent schools out performed governemt schools in average maths score, average reading score, % passing maths, % passing reading and % overall passing.

An interesting analysis of the data shows that for all average scores and passing percentages, students with spending ranges of <$585 achieved higher average scores and passing percentages than those in the top tier of spending ranges which was $645-680. One would think that students paying higher prices would be achieving higher scores, but this was not the case. 

But with the scores by school size section of our code, we can see that the small schools with less than 1000 students also achieved higher average scores and passing percentages than large schools with 2000-5000 students. Looking back at our data, we can also see that the government schools have signifantly more students than the independent schools and being larger schools, they also have a higher per student budget than smaller schools. So in conclusion, it can be determined that the reason why independent schools perform better overall is because they have less students on average than government schools, making it easier for their schools to achieve higher averages as there is a much smaller data set to compare.
